XXX: ADD STATUS OF THIS PROJECT IN PERCENT

::: my-watch-out
::: my-watch-out-header
WATCH OUT: This is my personal learning material and is therefore
neither an accurate replication nor an authoritative textbook.
:::

::: my-watch-out-container
I am writing this book as a text for others to read because that forces me to
become explicit and explain all my learning outcomes more carefully.
Please keep in mind that this text is not written by an expert but by a
learner.

Text passages with content I am already familiar I have skipped. Section
of the original text where I needed more in-depth knowledge I have
elaborated and added my own comments resulted from my personal research.

Be warned! In spite of replicating most of the content this Quarto book
may contain many mistakes. All the misapprehensions and errors are of
course my own responsibility.

## Content and Goals of this Book {.unnumbered}

This Quarto book collects my personal notes, trials and exercises of
[BOOK NAME](URL) by XXX: NAME OF AUTHOR [CITATION].

XXX: DESCRIPTION OF THE BOOK AND WHY IT IS WORTH FOR A QUARTO BOOK



## Text passages

### Quotes and personal comments

My text consists mostly of quotes from the [BOOK NAME].

::: my-example
::: my-example-header
::: {#exm-preface-quote}
: Quote
:::
:::

::: my-example-container
XXX: EXAMPLE QUOTE
:::
:::

Often I made minor editing (e.g., shorting the text) or put the content
in my own wording. In this case I couldn't quote the text as it does not
represent a specific text passage. In this case I end
the paraphrase with `(AUTOR NAME ibid.)`.

In any case most of the text in this Quarto book is not mine but coming
from different resources. 

::: my-example
::: my-example-header
::: {#exm-preface-note}
: Personal note
:::
:::

::: my-example-container
::: my-note
::: my-note-header
::: {#cor-preface-note-example}
: This is a personal note
:::
:::

::: my-note-container
In this kind of box I will write my personal thoughts and reflections.
Usually this box will appear stand-alone (without the wrapping example
box).

### Glossary

I am using the {**glossary**} package to create links to glossary
entries.\]

::: my-r-code
::: my-r-code-header
::: {#cnj-load-glossary}
: Load glossary
:::
:::

::: my-r-code-container


```{r}
#| label: load-glossary
#| lst-label: lst-preface-load-glossary
#| lst-cap: "Install and load the glossary package with the appropriate glossary.yml file"


## 1. Install the glossary package:
## https://debruine.github.io/glossary/

library(glossary)

## If you want to use my glossary.yml file:

## 1. fork my repo
##    https://github.com/petzi53/glossary-pb

## 2. Download the `glossary.yml` file from
##    https://github.com/petzi53/glossary-pb/blob/master/glossary.yml)

## 3. Store the file on your hard disk
##    and change the following path accordingly

glossary::glossary_path("../glossary-pb/glossary.yml")

```


:::
:::

If you hover with your mouse over the double underlined links it opens
an window with the appropriate glossary text. Try this example: `r glossary("Z-Score")`.

WATCH OUT! Glossary is my private learning vehicle

::: my-watch-out-container

![](https://debruine.github.io/glossary/logo.png)

I have added many of the glossary entries when I was working through
other books either taking the text passage of these books I was reading
or via an internet recherche from other resources. I have added the
source of glossary entry. Sometimes I have used abbreviation, but I need
still to provide a key what this short references mean.
:::

:::
:::

If you fork the [XXX: REPO OF THIS BOOK(URL OF THIS BOOK) then the glossary will not
work out of the box. Load down the `glossary.yml` file from [my
glossary-pb GitHub
repo](https://github.com/petzi53/glossary-pb/blob/master/glossary.yml),
store it on your hard disk and change the path in the code chunk
@lst-preface-load-glossary.

In any case I am the only responsible person for this text, especially
if I have used code from the resources wrongly or misunderstood a quoted
text passage.

## R Code and Datasets

XXX: EXPLAIN AND REWRITE DATA USAGE

I am using the package name also for the default installation of base R.
This wouldn't be necessary but it helps me to understand where the base
R functions come from. What follows is a list of base R packages of the
system library included into every installation and attached (opened) by
default:

-   {**base**}: The R Base Package
-   {**datsets**}: The R Datasets Package
-   {**graphics**}: The R Graphics Package
-   {**grDevices**}: The R Graphics Devices and Support for Colours and
    Fonts
-   {**methods**}: Formal Methods and Classes
-   {**stats**}: The R Stats Package
-   {**utils**}: The R Utils Package

I am not using always the exact code snippets for my replications
because I am not only replicating the code to see how it works but also
to change the values of parameters to observe their influences.

When it is clear then I will follow the advice from Hadley Wickham:

> When you call a function, you typically omit the names of data
> arguments, because they are used so commonly. If you override the
> default value of an argument, use the full name ([tidyverse style
> guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html)).

{**glossary**}: [Glossaries for Markdown and Quarto Documents](https://debruine.github.io/glossary/)

Add glossaries to markdown and quarto documents by tagging individual words. Definitions can be provided inline or in a separate file.

![](img/logoi/logo-glossary-min.png){width="176"}


There is a lot of necessary jargon to learn for coding. The goal of glossary is to provide a lightweight solution for making glossaries in educational materials written in quarto or R Markdown. This package provides functions to link terms in text to their definitions in an external glossary file, as well as create a glossary table of all linked terms at the end of a section.
